# TXTMerge
We needed a tool in the office to merge multiple csv files, and people were using the Windows CMD to make this.
Since our policies don't allow using the command prompt, i built this simple tool to help them with this task.

Simply select the folder where the files are located and select where would be the output.

For now it only works with CSV input and output.
